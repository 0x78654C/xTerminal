A Linux like terminal for windows with some extras.

![alt text](https://github.com/0x78654C/xTerminal/blob/main/media/1.bmp?raw=true)

## Requirements:

.NET 8 Runtime

 For Roslyn C# code runner use NuGet command in Commands project:
 ```
 Install-Package Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp -pre
 ```

 For Password Manager use NuGet command in Commands project:
 ```
 Install-Package Konscious.Security.Cryptography.Argon2
 ```

 For DiffPlex use NuGet command in Commands project:
  ```
 Install-Package DiffPlex -Version 1.7.1
 ```

 ## Auto suggestion for files and folders
xTerminal accepts auto suggestion for file and folder (depends on command use case) on following comands: 
cd, cat, ls, odir, hex, mv, fcopy, fmove, md5, edit, start, cp, del, ccs, sort

Example:
 ```
 ~> cd win
 ```
 Double press CTRL key and will suggest you all the directories that starts with the letters 'win' from current location.

  ```
 ~> start ap
 ```
 Double press 'CTRL' key and will suggest you all the files that starts with the letters 'ap' from current location.

    -------------------- Password Manager -------------------
    pwm       -- A simple password manager to store locally the authentication data encrypted for 
                 a application using Rijndael AES-256 and Argon2 for password hash.
                 Disclaimer: Use it at your OWN risk.
                 Useage of password manager commands:
                     -h       : Display this message.
                     -createv : Create a new vault.
                     -delv    : Deletes an existing vault.
                     -listv   : Displays the current vaults.
                     -addapp  : Adds a new application to vault.
                     -dela    : Deletes an existing application in a vault.
                     -updatea  : Updates account's password for an application in a vault.
                     -lista   : Displays the existing applications in a vault.

All xTerminal commands can be used from other terminals as <b>Command Line Arguments</b>. Example: 
 ```
 C:\work\xTerminal\xTerminal.exe extip
 ```

## Usage of C# Code runner and add-ons:

 For both ccs command and ! -add the code must be formatted and runned using the following example:

 ```C#
 using System;
// You can add more dependencies.

namespace Test_Code
{
   class Test
   {	
	  static void Main(string[] args)
	  {
		// Do the stuff.
	  }
   }
}
```
Now you can use Top Level Statement too.

## Usage of the Password Manager:

As most of the password managers we start by creating a vault where we store the applications data.
For that we use following command:
 ```
 pwm -createv
 ```
 You will be asked for the vault name and master password. Master password must meet the following complexity:
 ```
 Password must be at least 12 characters, and must include at least one upper case letter, one lower case letter, one numeric digit, one special character and no space!
 ````

 To see if the vault is created we list the current existing vaults by typing in console the following command:
 ```
 pwm -listv
 ```

 Adding the application information just type:
 ```
 pwm -addapp
 ```
 You will be prompted for vault name, master password to login in it, application name to be added, account name and password to be stored.

 To list the accounts from a specific application or entire vault lists type: 
 ```
 pwm -lista
 ```
 
 To delete a specific account from an application just use:
 ```
 pwm -dela
 ```

 To update password for a specific account in a application type:
 ```
 pwm -updatea
 ```

 To delete a vault type:
 ```
 pwm -delv
 ```

## Usage of pipe commands

### Here a simple examplenation how to use pipe commands:
- Begin commands: are used at the beginning of the pipe commands that stores the output for the next command.
- Middle commands: are used to manipulate data from first pipe command and output or transmit to next command.
- End commands: are used to display the output data from other commands and is used in the end of the pipe commands.

Here is the list of commands that work as with pipe too and which position:

![pipe3](https://github.com/0x78654C/xTerminal/assets/13780514/39e749a7-c772-4879-9e71-aa6479c18d0a)

Pipe commands cand be added even to alias commands.
You can use multiple pipe middle commands as well.
